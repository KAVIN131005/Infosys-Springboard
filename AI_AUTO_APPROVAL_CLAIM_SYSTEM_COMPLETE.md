## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Enhancements

#### 1. Enhanced ClaimService.java
```java
// AI Risk Assessment Algorithm
private double calculateRiskScore(SubmitClaimRequest request) {
    double confidenceScore = calculateConfidenceScore(request);
    double fraudScore = calculateFraudScore(request);
    double amountScore = calculateAmountScore(request.getClaimAmount());
    double completenessScore = calculateCompletenessScore(request);
    
    return (confidenceScore * 0.3 + fraudScore * 0.3 + 
            amountScore * 0.2 + completenessScore * 0.2) * 100;
}

// Immediate Payment Processing for AI-Approved Claims
private void processImmediatePayment(Claim claim) {
    try {
        PaymentRequest paymentRequest = new PaymentRequest();
        paymentRequest.setClaimId(claim.getId());
        paymentRequest.setAmount(claim.getClaimAmount());
        paymentRequest.setPaymentMethod("AUTO_APPROVAL");
        
        paymentService.processClaimPayment(paymentRequest);
        
        claim.setPaymentStatus("COMPLETED");
        claim.setPaymentDate(LocalDateTime.now());
        claimRepository.save(claim);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        logger.error("Payment processing failed for claim: " + claim.getId(), e);
        claim.setPaymentStatus("FAILED");
        claimRepository.save(claim);
    }
}
```

#### 2. PaymentService.java
```java
@Service
public class PaymentService {
    public PaymentResponse processClaimPayment(PaymentRequest request) {
        // Validate payment request
        validatePaymentRequest(request);
        
        // Process immediate payment for demo
        String transactionId = generateTransactionId();
        
        PaymentResponse response = new PaymentResponse();
        response.setTransactionId(transactionId);
        response.setStatus("SUCCESS");
        response.setAmount(request.getAmount());
        response.setPaymentDate(LocalDateTime.now());
        
        return response;
    }
}
```

### Frontend Enhancements

## 🔄 AI Auto-Approval Flow

### Risk Assessment Logic
```
Risk Score = (Confidence × 0.3) + (Fraud × 0.3) + (Amount × 0.2) + (Completeness × 0.2) × 100

IF Risk Score >= 90%:
  ✅ AI Auto-Approval
  💰 Immediate Payment Processing
  📧 User Notification
ELSE:
  👨‍💼 Admin Review Required
  ⏳ Pending Status
```

### Scoring Components
1. **Confidence Score** (30%): Based on claim details consistency
2. **Fraud Score** (30%): Fraud risk assessment
3. **Amount Score** (20%): Claim amount reasonableness
4. **Completeness Score** (20%): Document and information completeness

   - Status: ACTIVE
   - AI Assessment: "Auto-approved by AI - Risk Level: LOW"
   - Policy starts immediately

### **Scenario 2: Admin Approval Required (High Risk)**

## üìä AI Risk Assessment Logic

### **Risk Factors:**
```javascript
Base Score: 50 (Medium)

Age Adjustments:
- Under 25: +20 (Higher risk)
- Over 65: +30 (Higher risk)  
- 25-45: -10 (Lower risk)

Occupation Adjustments:
- Safe (Doctor, Engineer, Teacher): -10
- High-risk (Driver, Construction, Pilot): +15

Financial Check:
- Monthly premium > Monthly salary: Requires approval
- Good financial ratio: Helps auto-approval

Final Risk Levels:
- 0-30: LOW RISK ‚Üí Auto-approve
- 31-69: MEDIUM RISK ‚Üí Auto-approve (if other factors OK)
- 70-100: HIGH RISK ‚Üí Admin approval required
```

### **Auto-Approval Criteria:**
‚úÖ **All must be true:**
- Risk Level: LOW or MEDIUM (score < 70)
- Age: 18-65
- Financial Check: Premium ‚â§ Monthly Salary
- Policy doesn't require manual approval

‚ùå **Admin Required if any:**
- Risk Level: HIGH (score ‚â• 70)
- Age: Under 18 or Over 65
- Financial Check: Premium > Monthly Salary
- Policy requires manual approval
